//*INSPIRATION*\\
This app was built & presented – in it’s entirety – during the Mobile Development 1 graduation. A pretty impressive feat considering the developer hadn’t written one line of code prior to taking the 3-month, part time class! 

In his own words, this app was Rob’s ‘first dev gig.’ It is a good example of how a creative person with a project management or UI/UX background can build something in swift with minimal tech experience. And, the best part is that the alumnus was contracted to build this project, so he was able to make some money off of his new trade.

In sort, the student went from knowing nothing about Swift to launching a fully functional Murder Mystery Game in just over three months. Imagine that! 

//*TECHNOLOGY*\\
The tech parts of this app were pretty much all covered by week 9. The design was ‘borrowed’ from a workshop that was taught by the course’s TA, with a few minor adjustments. Surprise Industries, the client who contracted Rob to build this app, completed the audio recordings. The first View Controller contains a Table View that segues into an Audio View, passing the data that tells the app which episode to play. The Instructions are passed through an MFMailComposeViewController. The only portion of the app that is out-of-scope of GA’s Mobile Development course were the in-app purchases, but that code has been commented out for purposes of this Swift Guild App.

//*PARTICIPATE*\\
The Swift Guild community will showcase this app for one month. 

Please feel free to clone the repo and leave comments for the developer – your participation is greatly appreciated!
