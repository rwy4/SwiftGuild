//*INSPIRATION*\\
This app is providing a solution to one of the largest sports debates of our time – Should College Football Players Be Paid?

The solution is simple: leverage Venmo’s massive reach, viral nature, and open platform to show your favorite College Football player(s) your genuine appreciation. Since campaigns on Venbot are crowd-funded through Venmo, the NCAA is not authorized to touch a cent of the proceeds. After the player graduates, the Venbot team will give that player his username/password. 

If, for whatever reason, the NCAA has a problem with this initiative, the Venbot team will work with them to distribute ALL of the proceeds to a charity of the NCAA’s choosing. However, it should be noted that this idea incentivizes collegiate athletes to stay in school and graduate with a degree. Think about it this way -- if the player leaves school early to get paid by the NFL, then all the money that they raised will go to a charity of that player's choosing. If, however, they stay in school and graduate – regardless of what they do after they obtain their degree – they will be able to access this fund.

And, lastly, this app was also created with the hope that it will start a conversation about how Venmo publicizes our purchasing data to the entire world. This isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing, but we feel there are millions of millennials that should at least be conscious of it. In short – turn your Venmo Payments to ‘Private’ or don’t put information in your Messages that you don’t want analyzed by data aggregators. As long as you’re smart about using open platforms like Venmo then you have nothing to worry about. 

//*TECHNOLOGY*\\
There are four View Controllers at play here – the first three are Table View Controllers and the third has a Table View embedded inside a standard VC. The biggest tech challenge with this app was to maintain a consistent color scheme based on the Conference / School / Player that was selected. The developer pulled in a framework called “UIColorExtention” to convert HEX colors to RGB colors. Also, the developer imported a custom font “SFSportsNight” that was used throughout the app.

The Swift Guild community will showcase this app for one month. 

Please feel free to clone the repo and leave comments for the developer – your participation is greatly appreciated!
